Task: Write a playbook for lampstack automation ?


=> I created three servers 
  1) one server i named as Manual and in that server i checked all the manual steps are working are not. All the things are working perfectly
  2) Remaining two servers are one for Ansible Control node and slave node and i configured as passwordless authentication
    => create two users in two machines.
    => sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config  = using this command i make the password based authentication yes By default is no
    =>  ssh-keygen : using this command i generate the keys 
    =>  ssh-copy-id devops@172.31.51.31 i copy the public key from master  node to slave node and make that passwordless authentication.
    => installed ansible 
    => and write the playbook according to documentary : https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-ubuntu-18-04
